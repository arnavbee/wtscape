<p>Pessimism is self-fulfilling</p>
<p><strong>Naval:</strong> Professions in which you get your feedback from other members of that profession tend to get corrupted.</p>
<p>When you see a journalist writing articles to impress other journalists or a restaurant owner trying to impress other foodies and restaurant owners, it’s usually not practical or high-quality.</p>
<p>The journalist or restaurant owner may receive accolades within certain elite circles, but that doesn’t reflect reality.</p>
<p>A scientist or an experimentalist gets feedback from Mother Nature, and an entrepreneur gets feedback from a free market in which people vote with their money and time. Those are much better predictors.</p>
<p>People who get paid to operate in the real world tend to be optimistic. People who operate in ivory towers are incentivized to be pessimists.</p>
<p><strong>Brett:</strong> To be an entrepreneur, you need to be optimistic about the fact that you’re creating something that other people are going to find value in.</p>
<p>People who have a pessimistic philosophy tend to have a pessimistic psychology as well.</p>
<p>If you’re constantly thinking about all the ways in which the world is going to wreck and ruin, then this has a day-to-day impact on your outlook on everything—the rest of society, your family, and your friends—because you think this world is condemned.</p>
<p>You’re going to feel that weight on your shoulders, and that’s going to come through in how you present yourself to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>We see a lot of this on social media. Entrepreneurs are typically too busy to spend a whole lot of time on social media, but you get scientists, academics and journalists who are depressed with life because they have a pessimistic view of reality. That impacts their subjective experience of the world.</p>
<p>On the other hand, people who are creating are trying to bring something new into existence.</p>
<p><strong>Naval:</strong> Unfortunately, pessimism is self-fulfilling.</p>
<p>Here we take the stance that all evils are due to lack of knowledge. Rational optimism is the way out. The data supports it, and history supports it.</p>
<p>Through creativity, we can always come up with good explanations to improve our lives and everybody else’s lives.</p>
<p>So stay optimistic.</p>
