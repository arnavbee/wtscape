<p>Peace is happiness at rest</p>
<p><strong>Naval:</strong> In some ways, modern life is more hectic than prehistoric times. Our sources of stress are more chronic.</p>
<p>Let’s define stress. In physical terms, stress happens when something wants to be in two places at one time. If I apply pressure to both ends of an iron beam, I create stress on the beam because one part wants to be north and the other part wants to be south.</p>
<p><strong>Stress is an inability to decide what’s important</strong></p>
<p>In mental terms, stress is an inability to decide what’s important. You want two incompatible things at once. I want to relax, but I need to work. Now I’m under stress.</p>
<p>When you give up on something, it’s no longer stressful. When you accept that something’s out of your control, there’s no point in getting stressed about it.</p>
<p>The mind constantly creates stress, making you more paranoid or angry than situations warrant.</p>
<p>You want to find peace <em>from</em> mind. You aren’t turning off your brain. You can’t suppress the mind or force it to do anything. If I say, “Don’t think of a white elephant,” you’ll think of a white elephant.&nbsp; Rather, you want to develop tools so your mind can calm down on its own. Then, stress will go away naturally.</p>
<p>How do you do that? How do you end up with a more peaceful mind?</p>
<p><strong>Peace is happiness at rest</strong></p>
<p>Here’s a phrase I like: “Peace is happiness at rest; happiness is peace in motion.” Someone who’s peaceful at rest will end up happy when they do an activity. While a happy person sitting idle will be peaceful. The ultimate goal is not <em>happiness</em>, even though we use that term a lot. The goal is <em>peace</em>.</p>
<p>So the question becomes: How do you get to peace?</p>
<p>The first problem with attaining peace is that no activity will get you there. Fundamentally, peace is inactivity; it’s a sense that everything is fine.</p>
<p>If everything is fine, you’re not doing any physical or mental activity to change it. You’re also not wishing you were doing something to change it, because that creates stress.</p>
<p><strong>You cannot work toward peace, only understanding</strong></p>
<p>You cannot achieve peace directly or even work toward it. Rather, you can work toward understanding. There’s an old Sikh saying, “<a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Sikhism/Introduction">The name of God is truth.</a>” When you understand certain things and they become a part of you, you naturally become a more peaceful person.</p>
