<p>Wise people are quiet</p>
<p><strong>Naval:</strong> I put out this tweet a while back: “<a href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/1141919795735961600">The closer you are to the truth, the more silent you become inside</a>.”</p>
<p>We intuitively know this. When someone is blabbing too much or being the court jester, you know they’re not at peace. You know Robin Williams was not peaceful inside.</p>
<p><strong>Wisdom begets stoicism</strong></p>
<p>We expect a wise person like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laozi">Lao Tzu</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates">Socrates</a> to be quiet—not because they’re trying to look wise, but because they’re internally quiet. We understand that peace and wisdom go together.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/KapilGuptaMD?ref_src=twsrc%255Egoogle%257Ctwcamp%255Eserp%257Ctwgr%255Eauthor">Kapil Gupta</a>, who’s written far more on this topic than I have, said, “<a href="https://www.kapilguptamd.com/2019/03/21/wisdom-begets-stoicism-stoicism-does-not-beget-wisdom/">Wisdom begets stoicism. Stoicism does not beget wisdom</a>.” As you become wise, you naturally become stoic. You don’t become wise by being stoic. That’s reversing the cart and horse.</p>
<p>As an aside, one of my tweets the other day got incredibly misinterpreted. So many people failed that IQ test. I wrote, “<a href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/1184549088949350401?lang=en">The smarter you get, the slower you read</a>.” The speed reading crowd got triggered, and people said, “Well, Bill Gates reads 150 books per year.” Others said, “I read really slowly, so I must be smart.” They got it wrong. I said, “If A, then B.” That doesn’t mean, “If B, then A.”</p>
