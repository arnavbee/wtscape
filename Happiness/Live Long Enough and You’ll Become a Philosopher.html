<p>This podcast is a practical philosophy of health, wealth and happiness</p>
<p><strong>Naval:</strong> Let’s talk about why we’re doing this podcast. It’s really a discussion of highly practical philosophy.</p>
<p>Philosophy, as we normally think of it, is impractical. It’s abstract and obtuse—something written a long time ago in fancy language. We put it on a pedestal and it feels unapproachable. Sometimes it comes across like truisms.</p>
<p><strong>The big problems are the old ones</strong></p>
<p>But if you live long enough, you will become a philosopher yourself. You’ll have spent a lifetime solving the big problems in your life. The big problems are the old ones, the ones we’ve been trying to solve since the beginning: <em>How do I stay happy? How do I become healthy? How do I become wealthy? How do I raise the family I want?</em></p>
<p><strong>What one monkey can do, another can do</strong></p>
<p>This podcast is about practical philosophy that has worked for us. What one monkey can do, another can. We want people to think, “If this person learned something that made them happier, healthier or wealthier, then I can do it too.” That’s what we focus on: a practical philosophy of health, wealth and happiness.</p>
<p><strong>Nivi:</strong> If you summed it up in one word, it would be <em>health</em>: financial health, mental health and physical health.</p>
<p><strong>Naval:</strong> Health is a state of well-being. Let’s get to a state of <em>financial</em> health where we’re not fearful day to day. That’s where we started, and we spent a lot of time on that.&nbsp;Let’s get to a state of <em>physical</em> health where we’re not suffering from afflictions, disease and addiction. Let’s get to a state of <em>mental</em> health where we’re relatively at peace and quite content with ourselves.</p>
