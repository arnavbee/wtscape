<p><strong>Naval:</strong> What’s considered to be true is fought over. <a href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/1141844787705741312?s=21">Individuals search for truth but groups search for consensus</a>—and society is the largest group. So the biggest problem we run into is this: What society wants for you is not always what’s good for you.</p>
<p><strong>Even smart people go along with society’s lies</strong></p>
<p>Even smart, critical thinkers go along with many of society’s truths, knowing deep down they are lies.</p>
<p>Here’s a simple example: “Money won’t make you happy” is a social truth, but it’s not an individual truth. Look at all the individuals trying to make money. They know money can remove a lot of sources of unhappiness and get them to a point where happiness is under their control. It becomes their choice, as opposed to being inflicted upon them by external forces.</p>
<p>That is just one of many lies society tells you.</p>
<p>Another one of society’s lies is that you send your kids to school for education. In fact, they get an hour of education a day and indoctrination the rest of the time. They’re taught at the speed of the slowest student, and they’re mostly taught subjects that are irrelevant or obsolete.</p>
<p>School is a combination of a bit of education, large doses of socialization and compliance training, and a massive dose of babysitting—which is helpful for parents who can’t take care of their kids at home. It also keeps young troublemakers off the street.</p>
<p>School does a lot of things, but education is just a tiny piece of it. Homeschooling stats clearly show this, and even <a href="https://www.google.com/search?newwindow=1&amp;safe=strict&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk0085TrVoiHKO8R9-cU4UFx5Iynd3g:1583774871646&amp;q=unschooling&amp;spell=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjGnoOV9Y3oAhVHnp4KHVo3BhEQBSgAegQIHRAm&amp;biw=849&amp;bih=443&amp;dpr=1.5">unschooling</a> stats are starting to show it.</p>
<p><strong>Guilt is society training you to be your own warden</strong></p>
<p>Society does not just lie to you. It programs you to beat yourself up when you transgress one of its truths. Guilt is society programming you so effectively that you become your own warden. <a href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/906906655144648704?s=20">Guilt is society’s voice speaking in your head</a>.</p>
<p>Truth-seeking is a hard business. You essentially have to understand, with deep conviction, things that you’ve been programmed to misunderstand.</p>
